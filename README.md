# Progress-Tracker

## The Issue
The SGO Collective Consciousness needs a tool that will allow easy visualization of their students' progress. The tool will help in quantitative analysis of their curriculum for each student. Insights gained from the data will allow the organization to modify their curriculum and activities, based on the students' engagement and performance.


## Our Solution
We have created a solution for the benefit of Devi initiative facilitators. It contains dashboards to visualize the progress of each student. We also provide metrics to measure aggregate student performance, which can be used to identify common areas of difficulty/weakness. 
The facilitators can also see the common topics or questions in which majority of the students are facing diffculty in. These insights will help the organization modify their course content accordingly.
